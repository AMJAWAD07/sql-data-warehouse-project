# 📊 Data Warehouse & SQL Analytics Project (MySQL)

A comprehensive collection of MySQL scripts for data warehousing, analytics, and reporting using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold). This project showcases best practices in SQL development, data modeling, and exploratory analysis.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

• **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingested from CSV files into MySQL tables  
• **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, standardized, and normalized data  
• **Gold Layer**: Business-ready star schema with reporting views  

## 🚀 Key Features

• MySQL queries for:  
  • Data exploration & profiling  
  • KPI calculations (sales, quantity, revenue)  
  • Time-based trends (`DATE_FORMAT`, `YEAR`, etc.)  
  • Cumulative analytics & window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`)  
  • Customer & product segmentation  

• Modular SQL using CTEs and temp views (MySQL 8.0+)  
• Clean, structured logic for analytical workflows  

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

• MySQL Query Optimization  
• ETL Pipeline Simulation using SQL  
• Data Modeling (Star Schema)  
• Analytical Reporting Views  
• Medallion Architecture in MySQL  
• Window Functions & Aggregations
